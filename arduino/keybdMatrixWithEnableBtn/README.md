# JZ Keyboard

A mechanical keyboard built with an arduino leonardo. It will feature:
 - A tenkeyless layout (no number pad on the right)
 - 10 Macro keys M1 to M10 above the Function keys
 
# Status

At the moment the sketch works for a 2x2 matrix, ie. a 4 keys keyboard (a,b,c,d).

# Next step: 

 - Design the PCB with 100 keys (10x10 matrix)
